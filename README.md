## Setup Requirements
At the moment, we're using sqlite for portability. For production, we'll move to a RDBMS, like
MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

We need to install the spatial extension depending on your Operating System

Ubuntu: `$ sudo apt install gdal-bin`
Windows: 
MacOS: ``
### SQLite:
For SQLite database: SpatiaLite

on Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions (es: Debian, Ubuntu, â€¦):

`$ apt install libsqlite3-mod-spatialite`

on macOS using Homebrew:

`$ brew install spatialite-tools`
